## Results
Option 2. NYC AirBnB
I created map of New York City by Zip code and also by region to show location of the regions from dataset.
I created area chart to show amount of AirBnB in NYC from 2008 till 2015.
I created stacked bar chart to show room type and beds available to rent.
I created table with filters to show top five places in the area based on region, rating, room type and price.
I did cluster analysis to identify variable which has correlations to show them in dashboard.  
I created visual interactive dashboard for customers of AirBnB to easier find place to stay in NYC.

Questions which can be answered by my visualization of data:
1)	What are average prices for AirBnB based on region?
2)	What is the area with the most AirBnB listings?
3)	What are type of listings in each particular region?
4)	What is the number AirBnB listings per certain year?
5)	What are most popular listings in the area?
6)	What are the most popular listings based on review score and numbers of reviews?  



## Challenges 
Information is limited to the year range 2008-2015

## Future Goals
Expand the dashboard information to cover Halifax, Canada AirBnB
